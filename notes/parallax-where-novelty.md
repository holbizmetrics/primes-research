# PARALLAX: Where Might Prime Novelty Hide?

## Lens 1: Domain Expert (Analytic Number Theorist)
**What would they say?**

"Real progress comes from improving bounds. The action is in:
- Prime gaps (current best: Maynard-Tao sieve improvements)
- Error terms in prime counting functions
- Distribution in short intervals
- Patterns in arithmetic progressions

But these require deep analytic technique. Unlikely for outsider to contribute."

**Signal:** Avoid the main battlefield. Look elsewhere.

## Lens 2: Adjacent Expert (Combinatorialist)
**What would they say?**

"Primes have interesting combinatorial structure that number theorists sometimes miss:
- Prime graphs (p connected to q if |p-q| = 2)
- Hypergraph structures on prime tuples
- Ramsey-theoretic properties
- Additive combinatorics (Green-Tao direction)

Less explored: primes as a DYNAMICAL object. What happens when you iterate functions on primes?"

**Signal:** Iterative/dynamical perspective might yield something.

---

## Lens 3: First Principles
**What's actually true about primes?**

Strip away convention:
- Primes = multiplicatively irreducible integers > 1
- They're defined by what they AREN'T (not composite)
- Their distribution is the shadow of multiplication's structure
- Each prime "divides" the integers into residue classes

**Fresh angle:** What if we look at primes as DIVISORS rather than ELEMENTS? The set of n where p|n has structure. What about intersections?

---

## Lens 4: Adversarial
**How could any claimed "novelty" be wrong?**

- Already known under different name (high risk)
- True but trivial (provable in one line once stated)
- True but unverifiable (can't check computationally)
- Pattern breaks at larger scale (just didn't compute far enough)
- Artifact of base-10 or small numbers

**Defense needed:** Literature check, large-scale verification, multiple bases.

## Lens 5: Naive (Fresh Eyes)
**What would someone new notice?**

"Why does everyone study primes one at a time or in pairs? What about:
- The SEQUENCE of gaps as its own object
- Prime-indexed primes (2, 3, 5, 11, 31, ...)
- Primes that are also prime when reversed
- The NUMBER of primes below each prime (meta-counting)

Also: what happens if you DO something to primes? Add them? Multiply? Take to powers?"

**Signal:** Transform primes, study the result.

---

## Lens 6: Future (10 years)
**What will seem obvious in retrospect?**

"We had all this compute and we were still studying primes the same way as 1850. Someone eventually realized:
- Machine learning on prime sequences reveals structure
- Random matrix theory connection goes deeper than expected
- Primes in exotic number systems (p-adics, function fields) teach us about classical primes
- The DYNAMICS of prime-generating functions matter"

**Signal:** Apply modern computational/ML lens.

## SYNTHESIS: Tension Points

| Perspective | Says Look At |
|-------------|--------------|
| Expert | Bounds/intervals (but hard) |
| Adjacent | Dynamics/iteration |
| First Principles | Primes as divisors, intersections |
| Adversarial | Need verification strategy |
| Naive | Transforms, prime-indexed primes |
| Future | Computational/ML patterns |

**Convergence:**
- Dynamics/iteration on primes (3 lenses agree)
- Prime-indexed primes / meta-sequences (naive + adjacent)
- Computational pattern finding (future + naive)
