ANALYSIS 1: Radial Distribution Before/After Inversion
=================================================================

Original: small n → near center, large n → near surface
Inverted: small n → far out, large n → near center

n       Prime?  r (orig)    r (inv)     
----------------------------------------
2       YES     0.0040      250.0000    
3       YES     0.0060      166.6667    
5       YES     0.0100      100.0000    
10              0.0200      50.0000     
50              0.1000      10.0000     
100             0.2000      5.0000      
250             0.5000      2.0000      
499     YES     0.9980      1.0020      

=================================================================
ANALYSIS 2: Prime Clustering After Inversion
=================================================================

Prime density by inverted radius:
Radius range   Total     Primes    Density   
---------------------------------------------
[0, 0.5)     0         0         0.000     
[0.5, 1)     0         0         0.000     
[1, 2)     250       42        0.168     
[2, 5)     150       28        0.187     
[5, 10)     50        10        0.200     
[10, 50)     41        11        0.268     
[50, 500)     8         4         0.500     

=================================================================
ANALYSIS 3: Inside-Outside Exchange
=================================================================

Small primes (n ≤ 125): 30
Large primes (n > 375): 21

After inversion:
  - Small primes (2,3,5,7,...) are now FAR from center
  - Large primes (491,499,...) are now NEAR center

=================================================================
ANALYSIS 4: Angular Distribution Changes
=================================================================

KEY INSIGHT: Spherical inversion PRESERVES ANGLES!

The angular distribution (θ, φ) is the same before and after.
What changes is ONLY the radial distance.

So the spherical harmonic structure (l, m modes) is UNCHANGED.

But the RADIAL structure inverts:
- Primes that were "core" become "halo"
- Primes that were "halo" become "core"


=================================================================
ANALYSIS 5: The Composite Complement
=================================================================

Composites: 404

Highly composite numbers and their inverted positions:
n       Divisors  r (orig)    r (inv)     
------------------------------------------
360     24        0.7200      1.3889      
420     24        0.8400      1.1905      
480     24        0.9600      1.0417      
240     20        0.4800      2.0833      
336     20        0.6720      1.4881      
432     20        0.8640      1.1574      
180     18        0.3600      2.7778      
252     18        0.5040      1.9841      
288     18        0.5760      1.7361      
300     18        0.6000      1.6667      

After inversion, highly composite numbers (360, 420, 480...)
move toward the CENTER, while small primes (2, 3, 5, 7...)
move toward INFINITY.

This is the "dual view":
- Original: primes are the "atoms", composites fill space
- Inverted: composites concentrate at core, primes form halo


=================================================================
ANALYSIS 6: Other Geometries
=================================================================

SPHERE: Inversion through center
  - Clean mathematical inversion
  - Radial distances flip
  - Angles preserved

TORUS: More complex!
  - Has a hole (genus 1)
  - Inversion through center would...
    - Map inner surface to outer
    - The "hole" becomes the "exterior"
  - Creates interesting topology

ICOSAHEDRON:
  - 20 faces → 20 inverted faces
  - The "soccer ball cells" would invert
  - Dual polyhedron is the dodecahedron!

HELIX:
  - Inversion creates... involute spiral?
  - The "coiling" direction reverses sense


=================================================================
SYNTHESIS
=================================================================

GEOMETRIC INVERSION = T_inv applied to SPACE

What we learn:
1. Angular structure is PRESERVED (spherical harmonics unchanged)
2. Radial structure INVERTS (core ↔ halo)
3. Primes and composites exchange "inside/outside" roles
4. The DUAL VIEW reveals complementary structure

CTA chain:
  P(prime_geometry) ⊗ T_inv → P(inverted_prime_geometry)

The "inside-out" view shows what the original hides:
- Where do composites cluster?
- What's the structure of "prime absence"?
- The negative space has its own patterns.

NEXT: Combine inversion with wave propagation
      - Shine a wave from the center outward
      - vs. shine a wave from infinity inward
      - How do the scattering patterns differ?
