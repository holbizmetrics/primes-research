# Research Threads — Primes

## PRIME GOAL
Discover a novel, verifiable result about prime numbers.

## Threads

### THREAD 1: Unexplored Intersections — ACTIVE
Looking at primes through lenses of other mathematical structures.

### THREAD 2: Computational Pattern Hunt — PARKED
Systematic search for patterns in prime-derived sequences.

### THREAD 3: Digit/Representation Patterns — PARKED
Primes in different bases, digit sums, etc.

### THREAD 4: Second-Order Structures — PARKED
Patterns in gaps, in prime-indexed primes, in prime factorizations of prime-adjacent numbers.
