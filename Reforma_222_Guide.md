## Rental Income Potential

### Expected Returns

| Strategy | Annual Yield |
|----------|--------------|
| Long-term rental | 4-6% |
| Short-term (Airbnb) | 8-11% |
| Mid-term (30+ days) | 5-8% |

### Airbnb Numbers (Mexico City 2025-2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average annual revenue | $12,000-15,000 USD |
| Average daily rate | $88-91 USD |
| Occupancy rate | 49-50% |

### Important: 180-Night Cap

Mexico City limits short-term rentals to **180 nights per year**. This affects Airbnb income potential.

**Best strategy for Reforma 222:** Mid-term rentals (1-6 months) to digital nomads and corporate relocations. Higher rates, less regulation, quality tenants.

### Reality Check

A $600K property earning $15K/year on Airbnb = 2.5% gross yield. The premium price compresses percentage returns. You'd need $3,000+/month long-term rent to hit 6%.

**However:** Capital appreciation on Paseo de la Reforma has been strong (+30% in 5 years for prime CDMX neighborhoods).

## Buying Property in Mexico — What Foreigners Need to Know

### Can Foreigners Buy?

**Yes.** Mexico City is NOT in the restricted zone, so you can hold **direct title** (no trust needed).

### Restricted Zone (Not Applicable to CDMX)

- Within 50 km of coastline
- Within 100 km of international borders
- Requires "fideicomiso" (bank trust) — adds cost

**Mexico City = direct ownership, simpler process.**

### Requirements

| Document | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Valid passport | Required |
| RFC (Mexican tax ID) | Obtained during transaction |
| Residency/visa | NOT required — can buy as tourist |

### Costs to Expect

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Closing costs | 5-8% of purchase price |
| Acquisition tax | 2% |
| Annual property tax (predial) | 0.1-0.3% (low) |
| Notary fees | Included in closing |

**Tip:** Pay predial early for 20% discount.

### Taxes on Rental Income

| Tax | Rate |
|-----|------|
| Income tax (ISR) | 1.92-35% sliding scale |
| VAT | May apply to short-term rentals |

### Critical Warning: Ejido Land

**Never buy ejido (communal) land** without confirmed conversion to private property. This does NOT apply to Reforma 222 (urban, fully titled), but be aware when looking at other properties.
