# Primes Research — Finding Something New

**Prime Goal:** Discover a novel, verifiable result about prime numbers that is not currently known.

**Methodology:** Claude Research Skill v3.3.1 — Kernel Edition

**Activation:** FULL

## Barrier Awareness

Known hard problems (DO NOT expect to solve):
- Riemann Hypothesis
- Twin Prime Conjecture (bounded gaps proven, but conjecture open)
- Goldbach Conjecture
- Prime gap bounds (active research frontier)

Known barriers:
- Most "obvious" patterns have been checked computationally to 10^18+
- Analytic number theory techniques are mature
- Sieve methods well-developed

## Strategy

Look for:
1. **Unexplored intersections** — primes + other structures
2. **Computational patterns** — things hard to notice without compute
3. **New framings** — looking at primes differently
4. **Second-order patterns** — patterns in the patterns

## Tool Availability

- PARI/GP 2.17.3 (number theory specialized)
- Python 3.12.12 (general computation)
- Web search (literature check)
